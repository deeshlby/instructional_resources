# Setting up Python

If you have not already, install Anaconda Distribution on your local machine. This is a data science distribution of the Python/R programming languages. 

## Installing Anaconda and Configuring JupyterLab on Windows
1. Navigate to https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution in your web browser.  
2. Download 64-Bit Graphical Installer for Anaconda Distribution at the top of the page.  
3. Navigate to your Downloads folder and run the Anaconda3-2022.05-Windows-x86_64 executable.  
4. Follow the install wizard until you arrive at the screen shown below.   
     a) Anaconda cannot easily locate a folder path above the directory where it is currently installed. Please ensure that you are able to access both the repository and data folders from Anaconda.  
     b) Donâ€™t worry if it takes a few minutes to complete the installation process.
